# Face-Mask-Detection
Designed a deep learning-based system to detect face masks in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Achieved over 90% accuracy by training on a balanced dataset of 7,500 images, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras. Configured Google Colab with GPU acceleration for efficient model training and implemented preprocessing techniques to enhance classification performance. This system is capable of ensuring compliance with mask-wearing guidelines in various settings.
