# Face-Mask-Detection
Developed a deep learning-based Face Mask Detection System using CNN, achieving over 90% accuracy in real-time classification. Trained on a balanced dataset of 7,500 images with preprocessing techniques. Utilized TensorFlow and Keras on Google Colab with GPU acceleration for efficient model training and deployment.
